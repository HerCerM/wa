### Installation

Open a PowerShell console with **administrator priviliges**, and change the execution policy:

```text
set-executionPolicy -scope currentUser unrestricted
```

Run the installation script:

```text

```

Install AutoHotkey (AHK) using the installer from the website. Use 'Express Installation'.

Having now AHK installed, you can double click the script `wa.ahk` to start it. After you reboot your PC, the `wa.ahk` script will start automatically on every system boot, so no need to double click the AHK script again.

### After installation

I recommend to set back the execution policy to its default value:

```text
set-executionPolicy -scope currentUser restricted
```
